### Divine Sense

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an [[action]], you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any **celestial**, **fiend**, or **undead** within **60 feet** of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [[Hallow]] spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to **1 + your [[Charisma]] modifier**. When you finish a [[long rest]], you regain all expended uses.

### Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a [[long rest]]. With that pool, you can restore a total number of [[hit points]] equal to your **paladin level x 5**.

As an [[action]], you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend **5 hit points** from your pool of healing to **cure** the target of one **disease** or neutralize one **poison** affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Fighting Style

Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

- **Blessed Warrior.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[Cleric Spells#Cantrip|cleric spell list]]. They count as paladin spells for you, and [[Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the [[Cleric Spells#Cantrip|cleric spell list]].

- **Blind Fighting.** You have [[blindsight]] with a range of **10 feet**. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

- **Defense.** While you are wearing [[armor]], you gain a **+1 bonus to AC**.

- **Dueling.** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a **+2 bonus** to damage rolls with that weapon.

- **Great Weapon Fighting.** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the [[two-handed]] or [[versatile]] property for you to gain this benefit.

- **Interception.** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your [[reaction]] to reduce the damage the target takes by **1d10 + your [[proficiency bonus]]** (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a [[Omnomicon/Equipment/Shield|Shield]] or a [[Simple Weapons|simple]] or [[Martial Weapons|martial weapon]] to use this [[reaction]].

- **Protection.** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your [[reaction]] to impose [[disadvantage]] on the attack roll. You must be wielding a [[Omnomicon/Equipment/Shield|Shield]].

### Spellcasting

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your [[paladin spells]]. To cast one of your [[paladin spells]] of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[long rest]].

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [[Paladin Spells|paladin spell list]]. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your **[[Charisma]] modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down** (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [[Cure Wounds]], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a [[long rest]]. Preparing a new list of [[paladin spells]] requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

[[Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your [[Charisma]] whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your **[[Charisma]] modifier** when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Charisma]] modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Charisma]] modifier

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

### Divine Smite

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal [[radiant]] damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is **2d8** for a 1st-level spell slot, plus **1d8** for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of **5d8**. The damage increases by **1d8** if the target is an **undead** or a **fiend**, to a maximum of **6d8**.

### Divine Health

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you **immune** to **disease**.

### Sacred Oath

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.  

| Oath                     | Source                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Oath of the Ancients]] | Player's Handbook                                             |
| [[Oath of Conquest]]     | Xanathar's Guide to Everything                                |
| [[Oath of the Crown]]    | Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide                                |

| [[Oath of Vengeance]]    | Player's Handbook                                             |
| [[Oath of the Watchers]] | Tasha's Cauldron of Everything                                |
| [[Oathbreaker]]          | Dungeon Master’s Guide                                        |
###### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

###### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a [[Short Rest|short]] or [[long rest]] to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

### Harness Divine Power (Optional)

Also at 3rd level, you can expend a use of your [[#Channel Divinity]] to fuel your spells. As a [[bonus action]], you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than **half your [[proficiency bonus]]** (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, **once**; 7th level, **twice**; and 15th level, **thrice**. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Martial Versatility (Optional)

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can [[attack]] twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn.

### Aura of Protection

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within **10 feet** of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a **bonus** to the saving throw equal to your **[[Charisma]] modifier** (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be **conscious** to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to **30 feet**.

### Aura of Courage

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be [[frightened]] while you are **conscious**.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Improved Divine Smite

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra **1d8 [[radiant]]** damage.

### Cleansing Touch

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your [[action]] to **end one spell** on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **[[Charisma]] modifier** (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].
