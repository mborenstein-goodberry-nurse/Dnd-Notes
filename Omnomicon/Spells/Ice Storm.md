### [[Ice Storm]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*4th-level [[evocation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 300 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
**Duration**: Instantaneous

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a **20-foot-radius**, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a **[[Dexterity]] saving throw**. A creature takes **2d8 [[bludgeoning]]** damage and **4d6 [[cold]]** damage on a failed save, or **half** as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into [[difficult terrain]] until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by **1d8** for each slot level above 4th.
