### [[Destructive Wave]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*5th-level [[evocation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)
**Components**: V
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within **30 feet** of you must succeed on a **[[Constitution]] saving throw** or take **5d6 [[thunder]]** damage, as well as **5d6 [[radiant]]** **or** **[[necrotic]]** damage (your choice), and be knocked [[prone]]. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes **half** as much damage and isn’t knocked [[prone]].
