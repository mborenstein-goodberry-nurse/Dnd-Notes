### [[Fog Cloud]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*1st-level [[conjuration]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: 120 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 hour

You create a **20-foot-radius sphere** of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is [[heavily obscured]]. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by **20 feet** for each slot level above 1st.
