### [[Vortex Warp]]

Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos

*2nd-level [[Conjuration]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 90 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You magically twist space around another creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a **[[Constitution]] saving throw** (the target can choose to fail), or the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the range of the spell increases by **30 feet** for each slot level above 2nd.
