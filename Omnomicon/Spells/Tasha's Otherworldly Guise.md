### [[Tasha's Otherworldly Guise]]

Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

*6th-level [[transmutation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
**Range**: Self
**Components**: V, S, M (an object engraved with a symbol of the Outer Planes, worth at least 500 gp)
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute

Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- You are immune to [[fire]] and [[poison]] damage (Lower Planes) or [[radiant]] and [[necrotic]] damage (Upper Planes).
- You are immune to the [[poisoned]] condition (Lower Planes) or the [[charmed]] condition (Upper Planes).
- Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a **flying speed** of **40 feet**.
- You have a **+2 bonus** to AC.
- All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your **spell casting ability modifier** instead of [[Strength]] or [[Dexterity]] for the attack and damage rolls.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.
