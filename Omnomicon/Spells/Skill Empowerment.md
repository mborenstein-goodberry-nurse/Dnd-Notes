### [[Skill Empowerment]]

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*5th-level [[transmutation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Touch
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 hour

Your magic deepens a creature’s understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn’t already benefiting from an effect, such as **Expertise**, that doubles its proficiency bonus.
