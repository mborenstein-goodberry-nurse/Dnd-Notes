### [[Shatter]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level [[evocation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a chip of mica)
**Duration**: Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a **10-foot-radius sphere** centered on that point must make a **[[Constitution]] saving throw**. A creature takes **3d8 [[thunder]]** damage on a failed save, or **half** as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has [[disadvantage]] on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by **1d8** for each slot level above 2nd.
