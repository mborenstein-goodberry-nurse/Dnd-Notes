### [[Sleet Storm]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*3rd-level [[conjuration]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 150 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a **20-foot-tall cylinder** with a **40-foot radius** centered on a point you choose within range. The area is [[heavily obscured]], and exposed flames in the area are doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it [[difficult terrain]]. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a **[[Dexterity]] saving throw**. On a failed save, it falls [[prone]].

If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful **[[Constitution]] saving throw** against your spell save DC or lose [[concentration]].
