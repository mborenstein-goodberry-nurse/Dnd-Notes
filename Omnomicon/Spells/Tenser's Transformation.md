### [[Tenser's Transformation]]

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*6th-level [[transmutation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Self
**Components**: V, S, M (a few hairs from a bull)
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 10 minutes

You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can’t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain **50 [[temporary hit points]]**. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
- You have [[advantage]] on attack rolls that you make with [[Simple Weapons|Simple]] and [[Martial Weapons]].
- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra **2d12 [[force]]** damage.
- You have proficiency with all [[armor]], [[Omnomicon/Equipment/Shield|Shields]], [[Simple Weapons]], and [[martial weapons]].
- You have proficiency in **[[Strength]]** and **[[Constitution]] saving throws**.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.
Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a **DC 15 [[Constitution]] saving throw** or suffer one level of [[exhaustion]].
