### [[Burning Hands]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*1st-level [[evocation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a **15-foot cone** must make a **[[Dexterity]] saving throw**. A creature takes **3d6 [[fire]]** damage on a failed save, or **half** as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 1st.
