### [[Vampiric Touch]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*3rd-level [[necromancy]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Self
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes **3d6 [[necrotic]]** damage, and you regain hit points equal to **half** the amount of [[necrotic]] damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an [[action]].

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 3rd.
