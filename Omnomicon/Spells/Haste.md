### [[Haste]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*3rd-level [[transmutation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 30 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has [[advantage]] on **[[Dexterity]] saving throws**, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the [[Attack]] (one weapon attack only), [[Dash]], [[Disengage]], [[Hide]], or [[Use an Object]] action.

When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
