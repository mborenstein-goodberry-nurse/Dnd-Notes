### [[Silence]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level [[illusion]] ([[ritual]])*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: 120 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a **20-foot-radius sphere** centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [[deafened]] while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
