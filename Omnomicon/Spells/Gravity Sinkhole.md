### [[Gravity Sinkhole]]

Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

*4th-level [[evocation]] (dunamancy:graviturgy)*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 120 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a black marble)
**Duration**: Instantaneous

A **20-foot-radius sphere** of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a **[[Constitution]] saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature takes **5d10 [[force]]** damage, and is pulled in a **straight line** toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes **half** as much damage and isn't pulled.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by **1d10** for each slot level above 4th.
