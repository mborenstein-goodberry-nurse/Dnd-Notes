### [[Raise Dead]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*5th-level [[necromancy]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour
**Range**: Touch
**Components**: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than **10 days**. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with **1 [[Hit Points|hit point]]**.

This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an **undead** creature to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival – its head, for instance – the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a **-4 penalty** to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a [[long rest]], the penalty is reduced by **1** until it disappears.
