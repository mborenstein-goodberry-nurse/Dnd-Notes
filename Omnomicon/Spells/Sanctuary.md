### [[Sanctuary]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*1st-level [[abjuration]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[bonus action]]
**Range**: 30 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
**Duration**: 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a **[[Wisdom]] saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
