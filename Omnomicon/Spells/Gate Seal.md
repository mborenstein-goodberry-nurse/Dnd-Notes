### [[Gate Seal]]

Source: Planescape - Adventures in the Multiverse

4th-Level abjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 minute
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a broken portal key, which the spell consumes)
**Duration**: 24 Hours

You fortify the fabric of the planes within a **30-foot cube** you can see within range. Within that area, portals close and can't be opened for the duration. Spells and other effects that allow planar travel or open portals such as [[gate]] or [[plane shift]], fail if used to enter or leave the area. The cube is stationary.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled.
