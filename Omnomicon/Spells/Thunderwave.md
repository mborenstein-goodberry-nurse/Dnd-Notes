### [[Thunderwave]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*1st-level [[evocation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: Self (15-foot cube)
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a **15-foot cube** originating from you must make a **[[Constitution]] saving throw**. On a failed save, a creature takes **2d8 [[thunder]]** damage and is pushed **10 feet** away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes **half** as much damage and isn’t pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed **10 feet** away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to **300 feet**.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by **1d8** for each slot level above 1st.
