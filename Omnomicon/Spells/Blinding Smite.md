### [[Blinding Smite]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*3rd-level [[evocation]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[bonus action]]
**Range**: Self
**Components**: V
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, you weapon flares with a bright light, and the attack deals an extra **3d8 [[radiant]]** damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a **[[Constitution]] saving throw** or be [[blinded]] until the spell ends.

A creature [[blinded]] by this spell makes another **[[Constitution]] saving throw** at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[blinded]].
