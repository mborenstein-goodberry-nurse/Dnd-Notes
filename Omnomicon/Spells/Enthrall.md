### [[Enthrall]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level [[enchantment]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a **[[Wisdom]] saving throw**. Any creature that can’t be [[charmed]] succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has [[advantage]] on the save. On a failed save, the target has [[disadvantage]] on [[Perception|Wisdom (Perception)]] checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are [[incapacitated]] or can no longer speak.
