### [[Continual Flame]]

**Components**: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration**: Until dispelled

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
