### [[Aura of Life]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*4th-level [[abjuration]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)
**Components**: V
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 10 minutes

Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a **30-foot radius**. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each non-hostile creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum can’t be reduced. In addition, a non-hostile, living creature regains **1 [[Hit Points|hit point]]** when it starts its turn in the aura with **0 [[hit points]]**.
