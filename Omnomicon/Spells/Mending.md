### [[Mending]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*[[Transmutation]] cantrip*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute
**Range**: Touch
**Components**: V, S, M (two lodestones)
**Duration**: Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.
