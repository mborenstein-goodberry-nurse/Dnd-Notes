### [[Blur]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level [[illusion]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: Self
**Components**: V
**Duration**: [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has [[disadvantage]] on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with [[blindsight]], or can see through illusions, as with [[truesight]].
