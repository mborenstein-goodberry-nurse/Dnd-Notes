### [[Tidal Wave]]

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*3rd-level [[conjuration]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 120 feet
**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of water)
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to **30 feet** long, up to **10 feet** wide, and up to **10 feet** tall. Each creature in that area must make a **[[Dexterity]] saving throw**. On a failure, a creature takes **4d8 [[bludgeoning]]** damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a success, a creature takes **half** as much damage and isn’t knocked [[prone]]. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within **30 feet** of it.
