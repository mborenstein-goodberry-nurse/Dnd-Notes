### [[Catnap]]

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*3rd-level [[Enchantment]]*

**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: 30 feet
**Components**: S, M (a pinch of sand)
**Duration**: 10 minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall [[unconscious]] for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an [[action]] to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains [[unconscious]] for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a [[short rest]], and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a [[long rest]].
