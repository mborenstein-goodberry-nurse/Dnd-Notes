## Log
We decide to split the group. Marlus and I stay here with Ivan to watch over him while Findy, Scrap, and Marik go into town to try and change the culture
Ingrid will be sacrificed tonight 
Ingrid has been informed about what we've found out 
They're on their way to Blackchapel now
There's a large icon of Baraquiel the All-Watcher in there
The priests facilitate the tradition because the town's very close minded 
After some dialogue, the priests can help us facilitate the town taking Ivan in
