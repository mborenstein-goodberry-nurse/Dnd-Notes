## Log
Helga pulls Marlus aside 
Needs us to help her/them with somehting in Blackchapel, a city in Lirion 
She became a captain because they only care about magic users, which she is not. Blackchapel is where her sister is from, who she hasn't heard from for 20 something years. Today that changes, as she asks for help 
There is a festival every year, and while they try and keep it traditional, there's probably human sacrifices
There is a creature in the woods, the Old Glutton, that makes blackberry jam and eats people 
We aren't associated with Helga, not really, so we may be more able to help her 
*Tomorrow at nightfall is the time of the sacrifice* 
First loomsday of Mirber 
One of us is a Druid.... that is me.... and she gives us a diamond. Worth about 300 gp 
Old woman lived on the edge of the woods, like a guard 
I prep [[Revivify]] 
> [!alert] Long Rest!!!

We arrive in Blackchapel, where Blackberries are everywhere. Tavern called the Bramble Inn is open. The ship drops us off and leaves, so she can be nearby but not seen by the city
Atlas and iris are staying on the ship 
The sweet smell of Blackberries are stronger here 
They're dirnking a purple tinted mead, everyone's drunk, no one pays much mind to Marlus 
![[Blackberry Mead.png|Blackberry Mead]]
The Mead is delicious! I fill my waterskin with the mead and get a second glass 
Serious taboo about saying the people who go into the woods die 
The witch used to guard the woods, but she died, named Judith, who ran interference with Old Glutton. Lived in an old house on the edge of town, near the woods 
We forgot to ask what the Sister's name is...
Oh thank Kaycheck, we found her anyways 
Doesn't look like she's doing well.... I'm not surprised 
Findy goes to talk to her 
Strong prescence of Barrachial in Blackchapel 
Her name is Ingred Malcovich 
We go to the witch's house, where there is a solid line of trees at the beginning of the woods 
I shift into a [[Wolf (Creature)]] 
The woods smell of decay 
The door is somewhat open 
No one inside, looks like it was dated 100 years ago
We enter into a drawing room with a bookshelf, couch, octagonal coffee table, modified chess board, and a fireplace 
The white piece moves around, but stays in the black area and doesn't go very close to the colored side of the board 
House is more witchery than nature-y 
Very likely not a hag house 
![[Old Glutton Witch's Gameboard.png|Gameboard tracking the beast]] 
Findy's patron likes what she's been doing 
The board is tracking the beast, quite possibly containing it
more than 10 feet is when you're your own group 
Each square is a 10 ft by 10 ft 
> [!alert] Long Rest!!!

We find a kid. His name is Ivan. he's blindfolded, has a hole in his heart, and probably has been here a century 
He's from Blackchapel 
When he takes off the blindfold, people die 
He doesn't need to sleep, or the like, and he can't go in the sun 
The bell dulls him 
A long time ago someone came into the church in a dark cloak, a man, and looked at him, and he fell. Others helped, but when they looked at him they would die 
The man was a Devotee of Leylah
