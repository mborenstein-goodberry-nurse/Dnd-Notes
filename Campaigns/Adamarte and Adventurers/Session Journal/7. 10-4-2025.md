## Log
It is 4 am in-game as we head towards Atlas's house with Elodie
We basically cross the market district, but there's no one who sees us or cares to notice us. 
Elodie is hanging closest to Adrian 
Elodie is a drummer, Karissa is a marimba 
Atlas meets us at the door. She has not slept 
We tell Atlas and Iris about the events of the night 
Iris has the frilliest pajamas
She is now going to research 
	*Findy gets a dream "Your work is not over"*
The news of Teawhistle's death ahs spready like wildfire 
	*Marlus gets a weird dream too! Cool!
Familiar(?) woman in a red cloak greets him*
There is a wormlike creature writhing in his peripheral
"I am not yours witch!" "But you will be... I have my orders, and I cannot defy them."
Something begins to crawl over him and grab him. Deep blood-red thing, more liquid than creature, crawls onto his face, then onto his eyes as his vision goes red 
Then it goes away? 
The woman bats at a disruptive *illusory* butterfly, distracting her
![[Blue Butterfly.png|The Blue Butterfly in Question...]]
The scene dissolves and crumbles around him 
*Marlus wakes up* 
There is blood dripping from his eyes 
He cleans his face in the sink 
He wants to have a private word with Findy about it, no reason :)
Miss Sophia is one of the homeowners. I mention this because I doubt its in my previous notes 
Marlus tells Findy about the dream. They're tracking him now
Marlus wants to steal a boat and sail away. Findy thanks that's dumb
Findy wants to go to Tirnaglas
*Adrian wakes up now*
They want to go to Helga 
Iris is reading a book in a language we do not understand
*Recounts the letter's contents*
It is not a genie vessel, but an elemental brand. A legendary magic item lost at the Tear, 1500 years ago 
![[elemental_brand.png|The Elemental Brand]]
The top one is air, bottom one is earth, left one is water, right one is fire 
The sword is a Kopesh, lost in the Tear and existed long before it
It can be any sword for the wielder, traditionally shown as a Kopesh
Iris thinks the vessel is the sword 
it can change shape, has a lot of relations to genies, there's a lot of lore, but it can be a vessel 
There's a woman named Andrea Evans, a spy for the church of Laylah, daughter of Melissa evans, and she's using her connections of her daughter to get tot he elemental brand, and she's sure that the church of laylah has one of the items of baraquial, a magic item that they absolutely should not have 
They tried to make a 'super guy' with one of these items
Far Cliff mines, Elodie says that the flower guards were moving product there. Very invested in it
It's in Lirion, Laylah is after it. That's not good 
Iris is a junior priest of baraquial. She is also part of a tight group searching for artifacts like that 
She got the book from that group 
Calls themselves a cult
Iris recruits us to find the Elemental Brand 
We're going to kill and frame John for Teawhistle's death 
> [!abstract] John writes a letter:
> To those concerned, 
I, Beverly, and Doran, all from the Flowerguard, orchestrated a plot to kill Titus Teawhistle. We made up the Torchbearers and enlisted regular people through blackmail to force them to carry out this plan. When that failed, Beverly, Doran, and I killed Teawhistle and the other guards. Then I killed them. 
Sorry, 
John Wilson

Iris and Atlas are coming with us
It is now 2 pm
We drop off the letter 
I transform into a [[Hunter Shark (Creature)]], and carry Findy, while the others come on the rowboat
> [!Alert] Restroom Break 

We find Helga's ship: the ***Banshee Shiver*** 
> [!abstract] Helga's description
> She is wearing a fancy coat, hands on her hips, sternly looking at Marlus, human, captain 
> ![[Captain Helga.png|Captain Helga the Reaper]]

We explain the situation fully to Helga 
The Queens is Findy's employer 
Mentions that Findy has dreams of a familiar blood witch 
We tell Helga our abilities 
Findy's patron is her employers 
We're going to Lirion, then we'll spend 2 days going to Tirnaghlas
We're going to Falconvale 
The blood witch is from Marlus's cult, who specialized in blood magic 
Highly evolved and developing craft. Some operate as diviners, and act as leaders. One has been appearing in Findy's and Marlus' dreams. So they're coming one or both of us 
Findy whispers to the captain "He really just needs to be dealt with. If that means my employers deal with him or we do, it needs to be done."
> [!success] We Level up to Level 5!
