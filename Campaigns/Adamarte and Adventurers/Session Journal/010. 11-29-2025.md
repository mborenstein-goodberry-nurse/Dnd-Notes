## Log
We start outside the Tavern in the morning
We've seen no elves in this town. Seems mostly human-centric. Some halflings
[[Marik Faros]] gets a proper Lirion Breakfast
Marlus and I are dirnkin' 
[[Findy Findabair]] tells the barmaid that they met the Old Glutton 
The bell tower, which has been ringing this whole time, stopped ringing for a minute 
Ivan started going full horror movie (twitching, blood from his heart-hole, etc)
I rang the small bell, it calmed him down until the bell returns 
Now it's tinny and off beat 
The others check it out, at the titular chapel, and its broken 
They all fail their [[perception]] check 
[[Marlus]] feels the Bell Vibes 
[[Scrap]] is going to fix it 
They fail their [[persuasion]] check, but they'll let him work on it under great supervision 
Ivan's blood is definitely Laylah product blood, similar to but more potent than Marlus's blood. dripping like gasoline 
Marlus and I run to the chapel, leaivng Ivan behind 
We see a hooded figure, and learn that she was the one that broke it
We chase after the hooded figure 
As we get to the bottom... its a human woman. It's Adrian. But as he/she used to be... as an adult? It's [[Andrea]] 
[[Omnomicon/Gameplay/Initiative|Initiative]] Time!!! 
[[Marlus]] clocks her as she runs out 
Findy does omega damage to ehr and hexes her 
Her AC is 15 
Lol, get [[Hold Person]]'d 
She is a changeling that replaced me when I was taken as a child 
Her last name is Evans 
Andrea Evans 
Councilwoman Melissa Evans is a member of the Lirion Council 
Meanwhile Marlus recognized her as a member of one of her cultists 
Oh cool, she helped kill Marlus. Fun 
She brought the knife used for his sacrifice 
She disappeared in a puddle of goop, similar to the Laylah blood magic 
We rush to Ivan, he's ok and undisturbed
We're trying to figure out what to do with him 
We eventually decide that we're going to kill him

Ivan rips off his blindfold. Everyone looks away except for [[Findy]] 
Umm... so looking is bad news bears. He's doing the same thing looking at me without me looking 
We tell [[Ingrid]] the good news after harvesting some bits and bobs from Ivan's corpse
[[Marlus]] demands payment in the form of an embarrassing story about the captain 
She tells us that her childhood stuffed animal was a donkey named Tiger 
We get back to the boat, the Banshee Shiver 
We bring some blackberry jam 
It is Mirber the 5th, Moonday
Marik's real name is Florian 
He sees his father as a ghost 
His father was a member of the council of [[Lirion]], and he died one night from unexpected murder by uncle 
He tried to kill his uncle, failed, and was framed for his murder
